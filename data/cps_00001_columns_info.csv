SERIAL,Household serial number,contin,"SERIAL is an identifying number unique to each household in a given survey month and year.  All person records are assigned the same serial number as the household record they follow.  A combination of YEAR, MONTH, and SERIAL provides a within-sample unique identifier for every household in IPUMS-CPS; YEAR, MONTH, SERIAL, and PERNUM uniquely identify every person within a single sample.

SERIAL is a new value generated for IPUMS-CPS and should not be confused with the household serial number created by the Census Bureau and included in the original CPS data.",{},0

CPSID,"CPSID, household record",contin,"CPSID is an IPUMS-CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies households across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSID index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSID allows users to link a household record across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSID value based on a combination of household identifiers. CPSID will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, a household will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. CPSID Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSID is available elsewhere.

CPSID may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. Users should note that ASEC oversample households (as indicated by ASECOVERH) will always have a CPSID value of 0.

Users may also want to see CPSIDP for more information about linking individuals across time using a person-specific version of CPSID.",{},0
ASECFLAG,Flag for ASEC,discrete,ASECFLAG indicates whether the respondent is part of the ASEC or the March Basic. This variable is useful for users who wish to distinguish ASEC and March Basic files in their extracts. See further information about the ASEC versus the March Basic Monthly Files.,"{1: 'ASEC', 2: 'March Basic'}",0
ASECWTH,Annual Social and Economic Supplement Household weight,contin,"ASECWTH is a household-level weight that should be used to generate statistics about households in March Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement data. The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. 

ASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights. The old values are available here: Old SPM and Weights Values.",{},0
HHINTYPE,Type of household,discrete,"HHINTYPE is a household-level variable indicating whether members of the household were interviewed and, if not, why no interview took place.  Type A nonresponse households represent housing units suitable for inclusion in the survey whose residents were not interviewed for reasons such as refusal to participate and temporary absence.  Type B nonresponse households were vacant or were occupied by persons ineligible for interview (e.g., institutionalized persons).  Type C nonresponse households were housing units that were demolished, converted to storage or business use, or included in the sample by mistake.

Sampling for the CPS is based on housing units (addresses) rather than persons.  For this reason, interviewers necessarily initially visit some unoccupied or uninhabitable dwellings.  Participation in the survey is voluntary, rather than required by law, and institutionalized persons are intentionally excluded.","{1: 'Interview', 2: 'Type A non-interview', 3: 'Type B/C non-interview'}",0

CBSASZ,Core-based statistical area size,discrete,"CBSASZ identifies the population size of the core based statistical area (CBSA) in which the household is located. CBSA's are classified as either metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas, but micropolitan areas are too small to be identified in the CPS public use microdata, so CBSASZ provides sizes of metropolitan areas only.

METFIPS,Metropolitan area FIPS code,contin,"METFIPS gives the original (unrecoded) codes for the respondent's metropolitan area of residence. For the same variable recoded to FIPS codes from the 1990 census, see (METAREA) (definitions of metropolitan areas can change over time, however). METFIPS information was added to the ASEC CPS data by the Census Bureau, not collected from respondents.

Not all metropolitan areas are identified: see under ""Codes"" for more information. Note also that some component counties are not included in the CPS sample of households in certain metropolitan areas. See the ""Specific Metropolitan Identifiers"" Appendix of the appropriate month's technical documentation for more information on whether a specific metropolitan area sample has excluded components. For more information on the definitions and components of metropolitan areas over time, see the Census Bureau website; for the current metropolitan area definitions, see here.

Note that the Census Bureau warns: ""One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution.  These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates.""",{},0
INDIVIDCC,Individual principal city,contin,"A ""principal city"" is the largest city in a metropolitan area. Other cities in a metropolitan area can also be designated principal cities if they meet certain requirements. INDIVIDCC indicates which principal city is the household's city of residence. Not all principal cities are identified, and many households do not live in a principal city or a metropolitan area, and so INDIVIDCC is not identified. INDIVIDCC must be used along with METFIPS and (sometimes) COUNTY or STATEFIP to uniquely identify cities (more information is under the ""Codes"" tab). Note that for many cities, sample sizes will be too small to provide reliable city-level statistics.",{},0
OWNERSHP,Ownership of dwelling,discrete,"OWNERSHP indicates whether the household rented or owned its housing unit. Households that acquired their unit with a mortgage or other lending arrangement were understood to ""own"" their unit even if they had not yet completed repayment. 

Two types of renters were identified: those who paid cash rent and those who paid no cash rent.  The latter category included occupants who paid only for their utilities.","{0: 'NIU', 10: 'Owned or being bought', 21: 'No cash rent', 22: 'With cash rent'}",1
HHINCOME,Total household income,contin,HHINCOME reports the total money income during the previous calendar year of all adult household members.  The amount should equal the sum of all household members' individual incomes as recorded in the IPUMS-CPS variable INCTOT.  The persons included were those present in the household at the time of the survey.  People who lived in the household during the previous year but were not still living there at the time of the survey are not included; household members who lived elsewhere during the previous year but had joined the household at the time of the survey are included.,{},1
PUBHOUS,Living in public housing,discrete,"PUBHOUS indicates whether the house, apartment, or mobile home is part of a government housing project for people with low incomes, commonly known as a ""public housing project.""

Participation in public housing is determined by two factors: program eligibility and the availability of housing. Income standards for initial and continuing occupancy vary across local housing authorities, although Federal guidelines set broad limits. Rental charges define net benefits and cannot exceed 30 percent of the family's or the individual's net monthly income. A public housing unit can be occupied by a family of two or more related persons or an individual who is handicapped, elderly, or displaced by urban renewal or natural disaster. 

An alternative form of housing assistance is rent subsidy, in which the rent for a housing unit is reduced because the Federal, state, or local government is paying part of the cost.  See (RENTSUB).
 
Households coded as ""Yes"" in PUBHOUS or RENTSUB were receiving housing assistance at the time of the ASEC survey.  The reference period for some other non-cash benefits is the preceding calendar year (for Food Stamps) or the previous six months (for heat subsidy). 

For some variables relating to means-tested government assistance, including PUBHOUS, information was collected only from households whose estimated income fell below a given threshold.  During the first month that a household entered the survey, and one year later, the CPS interviewer asked the respondent to estimate the family's total income in the past twelve months, by choosing one of fourteen broad categories.  Only households in which the household members' combined income fell below a given level (e.g., under 30,000 dollars in the 1980s) were questioned about means-tested program benefits.  Households with estimated incomes above the threshold were presumed to not qualify for or receive such benefits, and were not asked these questions, to limit the length of interviews.  Households that were not questioned were coded as ""no"" for several variables relating to the receipt of means-tested benefits, including PUBHOUS.","{0: 'NIU', 1: 'No', 2: 'Yes'}",1
RENTSUB,Paying lower rent due to government subsidy,discrete,"RENTSUB indicates whether the rent on the house, apartment or mobile home is reduced because a Federal, state or local government is paying part of the cost. With rent subsidies, the difference between the ""fair market"" rent and the rent charged to the tenant in private sector housing is paid to the owner by a government agency, using federal, state, or local funds.  See also (PUBHOUS) for information on public housing, an alternative form of housing assistance to low-income families and individuals.

HEATSUB,Received energy subsidy,discrete,"HEATSUB indicates whether the household had been enrolled in or had received benefits from the Federal home heating and cooling assistance program at any time since the beginning of October of the previous year. 

The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides financial assistance to qualified households to help them pay heating costs. The program is funded by the Federal government and administered by the States under broad guidelines. In some states a household may automatically be eligible for this program if the members receive: (1) Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC); (2) Food Stamps; (3) Supplemental Security Income (SSI); or (4) certain Veterans' benefits. 

(HEATVAL) gives the total value of energy assistance received in the past six months.  (HEATPAY) specifies the form of payment for heat subsidy recipients.  (NOHEAT) identifies households that reported being without heat for one or more days in the past six months, due to inability to pay the utility or fuel bill.  (FUELHEAT) specifies the type of heating fuel used, for households receiving energy assistance.

For some variables relating to means-tested government assistance, including HEATSUB, information was collected only from households whose estimated income fell below a given threshold.

HEATVAL,Value of energy subsidy,contin,"HEATVAL specifies the total value of energy assistance the household received since October 1 of the previous year.  To identify households receiving energy assistance, see (HEATSUB).  For information about the form of payment for energy assistance, see (HEATPAY).",{},1
FOODSTMP,Food stamp recipiency,discrete,"FOODSTMP indicates whether one or more members of the household received benefits from the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the prior year. This program is formerly known as the Food Stamps program.

Once such a household was identified, three follow-up questions were asked.  The first question determined the number of current household members covered by Food Stamps during the previous calendar year (STAMPNO).  The second question determined the number of months that Food Stamps were received during the previous year (STAMPMO).  Finally, a last question determined the total face value of Food Stamps received during that period (STAMPVAL).

The Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted to increase the food purchasing power of eligible households through the use of coupons to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Food Stamp Program through State and local welfare offices. The Food Stamp Program is the major national income support program which provides benefits to all low-income and low-resource households, regardless of the person's characteristics (e.g., sex, age, disability, etc.). The Food Stamps program was renamed SNAP as part of the Farm Bill of 2008.

For some variables relating to means-tested government assistance, including FOODSTMP, information was collected only from households whose estimated income fell below a given threshold.

LUNCHSUB,Government school lunch food subsidy,discrete,"LUNCHSUB identifies households where some or all of the children received free or reduced price school lunches. 

Funded by a combination of Federal funds and matching State funds, the National School Lunch Program helps States provide a school lunch for all children at moderate cost. The National School Lunch Act of 1946 was amended in 1970 to provide free and reduced-price school lunches for children of needy families. The program is administered by the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through State educational agencies, or through regional USDA nutrition services for nonprofit private schools. 

All students eating lunches prepared at participating schools pay less than the total cost of the lunches. Some students pay the ""full established"" price for lunch (which itself is subsidized); others pay a ""reduced"" price for lunch; and still others receive a ""free"" lunch. Students receiving free lunches live in households with incomes below 125 percent of the poverty level; students receiving reduced price lunches (10 to 20 cents per meal) live in households with incomes between 125 percent and 195 percent of the official poverty level. The data in the ASEC CPS do not distinguish between children receiving free versus reduced-price school lunches. 

To collect information on the school lunch program, interviewers first asked whether any of the children (ages 5-18) in a household ""usually"" ate a hot lunch and, if so, the number of children doing so (ATELUNCH). If some children in the household usually ate hot lunch at school, the interviewer asked about whether any of the children received free or reduced price hot lunches, and, if ""Yes,"" how many did so. See (FRELUNCH).

For some variables relating to means-tested government assistance, including LUNCHSUB, information was collected only from households whose estimated income fell below a given threshold.

FAMINC,Family income of householder,discrete,"FAMINC reports annual family income, in categories, of all persons related to the head of household/householder. For individuals who are not part of the householder's family, FAMINC reports the value for the householder's family. 

This measure includes the income of all members of the household who are 15 years of age or older.  Income includes money from jobs; net income from business, farm or rent; pensions; dividends; interest; Social Security payments; and any other monetary income received by family members.

Family income is collected as part of the basic monthly survey.

CPSIDP,"CPSID, person record",contin,"CPSIDP is an IPUMS CPS defined variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. The first six digits of CPSIDP index the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. CPSIDP allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern, by assigning a unique CPSIDP value to this line number. CPSIDP will only ever appear for a maximum of 8 times, which is the number of times a household may be observed in the CPS survey (as indexed by MISH). In some cases, individuals will appear fewer than 8 times due to migration, mortality, non-response, and recording errors. Extensive documentation about the creation of CPSIDP is available elsewhere.

Users should note that it is important to verify CPSIDP linkages with AGE, SEX, and RACE. In some cases CPSIDP will result in erroneous links, which are due to errors in the source data. Cases with the same CPSIDP value may also have inconsistent responses across samples due to errors on the part of the respondent or in recording the response. Ultimately, it is up to the individual researcher to determine the acceptability of the linkages made using CPSIDP. 

CPSIDP may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDP, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDP and MISH to create a person-time file. 

Users should take care when including the March Basic or ASEC as part of their linking. Respondents who are part of the ASEC oversample (as indicated by ASECOVERP) have a CPSIDP value of 0. For further information about the relationship between the March Basic and the ASEC, please see our additional documentation.",{},0
CPSIDV,Validated Longitudinal Identifier,contin,"CPSIDV is an IPUMS CPS-created variable that uniquely identifies individuals across CPS samples. In addition to linking records across the CPS 4-8-4 rotation pattern, CPSIDV only makes links between those records whose SEX and RACE values do not change and whose AGE values change in expected ways over time. 

CPSIDV is based on CPSIDP and so there are some structural similarities between them. The first six digits of CPSIDV are identical to CPSIDP - the four-digit year and two-digit month that the household was first in the CPS. Like CPSIDP, CPSIDV allows users to link a respondent appearing with a designated household roster line number (LINENO) across samples, based on the 4-8-4 rotation pattern. 

Only records that link using CPSIDP that also have consistent race and sex values and age values that increase at least one but not more than two years over the course of the 16-month CPS rotation are linkable using CPSIDV. As a result, linkage rates using CPSIDV are slightly lower than those achieved using CPSIDP. However, linkages created with CPSIDV do not require the recommended post-linking verification steps recommended for use with CPSIDP links. Users should note that original, unharmonized values of age, sex, and race are used in the creation of CPSIDV. The procedure and validation criteria for creating CPSIDV are described in detail in A Holistic Approach to Validating Current Population Survey Panel Data. 

CPSIDV may also be used to link ASEC respondents who are in the March Basic Monthly file to other months of CPS data. This linking is made possible by IPUMS through the creation of MARBASECIDP. 

To get started using CPSIDV, users may want to sort their data file by CPSIDV and MISH to create a person-time file.

ASECWT,Annual Social and Economic Supplement Weight,contin,"ASECWT is a person-level weight that should be used in analyses of individual-level CPS supplement data. Since the CPS relies on a complex stratified sampling scheme, it is essential to use one of the provided weighting variables.

Researchers should use WTFINL rather than ASECWT when they wish to conduct person-level analyses of non-ASEC data. EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

User Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.

The ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.

ASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. 

Estimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.

Two important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls. IPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights.",{},0
RELATE,Relationship to household head,discrete,"RELATE reports an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder.

CPS interviewers collected detailed information about the precise relationships of all persons in the household in their initial listing of household members.  Unfortunately, they then simplified the detailed data (e.g., daughter-in-law, lodger's brother) by coding it into a few broad categories (e.g., ""other relative of head,"" ""nonrelative of head with own relatives in household"") specified on the interview form.  Only the broad categories are preserved in the data.

All persons with a RELATE code less than 1100 are included in FAMUNIT 1.  All persons with a RELATE code of at least 1100 receive a FAMUNIT code of 2 or greater unless they are linked via birth, marriage, or adoption to someone with a RELATE code of less than 1100.  This means that some households contain no persons with a FAMUNIT code of 1: for example, household fragments (identified via FRAGMNT) receive a FAMUNIT code of 2.

The Census Bureau defines ""primary families"" as groups of persons related to the head of household, and ""primary individuals"" as household heads/householders residing without kin.

ASPOUSE,Spouse line number (self-reported),contin,"ASPOUSE is a variable that indicates whether the person's spouse lived in the same household and, if so, gives the line number (LINENO) of the spouse. ASPOUSE makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of spouses. 

Beginning in 2007, CPS respondents have also been asked to identify cohabiting partners, mothers, and fathers. Respondents also identified cohabiting partners (PECOHAB), mothers (PELNMOM), and fathers (PELNDAD).  These variables are reported as is and may need additional cleaning by researchers.

ASPOUSE is similar to the IPUMS-CPS constructed variable SPLOC which identifies probable spouses on the basis of marital status, relationship to household head, age, and additional demographic characteristics. SPLOC is available in all years and in most instances, SPLOC and ASPOUSE will identify the same spouse. Disagreements may occur in ambiguous situations or as a result of reporting errors. Note that SPLOC references the spouse's person number (PERNUM), while ASPOUSE provides the line number (LINENO).

PECOHAB,Cohabiting partner line number (self-reported),contin,"PECOHAB is a variable that indicates whether the person's cohabiting partner lived in the same household and, if so, gives the line number (LINENO) of the partner. PECOHAB makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of cohabiting partners. 

Since 2007, unmarried respondents in households with unrelated adults have been asked: ""Do you have a boyfriend, girlfriend or partner in this household?"" If they responded yes, the respondent was then asked to identify the cohabiting partner and the interviewer recorded the partner's line number. The same question was posed about all other unmarried adults in the household except persons identified as the unmarried partner of the household head. PECOHAB provides the line number of cohabitors identified through this direct question on cohabitation and of persons identified as the unmarried partner of the household head. PECOHAB is reported as is and may require additional cleaning by researchers. 

In the years 1995-2006, researchers can identify most cohabitors using the unmarried partner category in the relationship to household head variable (RELATE). About 80 percent of cohabiting couples can be identified through this method.

In addition to cohabiting partners, respondents also identified spouses, (ASPOUSE), mothers (PELNMOM), and fathers (PELNDAD).

FTYPE,Family Type,discrete,"FTYPE reports the Census family type of each person in a household. Note that the Census family is not necessarily the same as the IPUMS-derived family as give in FAMUNIT. The Census family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family. Any family level variable depends directly on this variable in that all members of each CPS-identified family unit are assigned the same value for any given family level variable. The Census Bureau poverty statistics are developed with the family interrelationships defined by FTYPE. 

Recall that a household includes the related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also counted as a household. For more on the Census family definitions, see below as well as the description for FAMREL.

A family household is a household maintained by a householder who is in a family (as defined above), and includes any unrelated people (unrelated subfamily members and/or secondary individuals) who may be residing there. The number of family households is equal to the number of families. The count of family household members differs from the count of family members, however, in that the family household members include all people living in the household, whereas family members include only the householder and his/her relatives.

A primary family consists of a married couple with or without children, or one parent with one or more own never married children under 18 years old, who maintain the household.

A nonfamily householder consists of a householder living alone (a one-person household) or where the householder shares the home exclusively with people to whom he/she is not related. 

A subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain their own household, but lives in the home of someone else.

A related subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or one parent with one or more own never married children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not including, the person or couple who maintains the household. One example of a related subfamily is a young married couple sharing the home of the husbands or wife's parents. The number of related subfamilies is not included in the count of families.

An unrelated subfamily (formerly called a secondary family) is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old living in a household. Unrelated subfamily members are not related to the householder. An unrelated subfamily may include people such as guests, partners, roommates, or resident employees and their spouses and/or children. The number of unrelated subfamily members is included in the total number of household members, but is not included in the count of family members.

Secondary individuals (formerly called unrelated individuals) are people of any age who reside in a household, but are not related to the householder (except unrelated subfamily members). People who reside in group quarters are also secondary individuals. Examples of a secondary individual include (1) a guest, partner, roommate, or resident employee; (2) a foster child; or (3) a person residing in a rooming house, a halfway house, staff quarters at a hospital, or other type of group quarters.

For more information, see the Census Bureau's page on CPS definitions.","{1: 'Primary family', 2: 'Nonfamily householder', 3: 'Related subfamily', 4: 'Unrelated subfamily', 5: 'Secondary individual', 9: 'Missing'}",0
FAMREL,Relationship to family,discrete,"FAMREL states the person's relationship to their Census-defined subfamily unit. The Census subfamily type is identified in FTYPE. Values of Census family-level variables such as FTOTVAL are valid for the respective subfamily unit.

Note that IPUMS and the Census Bureau define subfamilies differently. Subfamilies in IPUMS CPS can be identified using the variables MOMLOC, POPLOC and SPLOC. Any subfamilies identified using these variables are not necessarily the same as any Census subfamilies. The IPUMS-defined variable FAMUNIT identifies families according to IPUMS rules (not Census rules), but does not identify (related) subfamilies. FAMREL and FTYPE refer to Census-defined subfamilies. See here for a description of IPUMS subfamilies and their relation to Census subfamilies. IPUMS CPS does not currently offer IPUMS subfamily identifiers such as IPUMS USA's SUBFAM. Below is a brief description of the Census family/subfamily concept as it concerns FAMREL.

Each CPS household has one person designated as the householder, who is the person in whose name the housing unit is rented or own. The CPS splits households into family, subfamily, and individual units. The primary family is the householder and everyone related to the householder. For the purposes of FAMREL and FTYPE, and following some CPS documentation, ""primary family"" will be used as shorthand for ""primary family only"", or the householder and his/her immediate family: that is, the primary family less any subfamily units. In addition to the primary family, a household can also contain subfamily units related to the primary family (related subfamily, or subfamily units that are extended family to the householder), as well as unrelated subfamily units, which are immediate family units with no relation to the householder. Additionally, the household can contain individuals who are not part of any family/subfamily unit, such as guests, boarders, or individual resident employees (i.e. those not living with the resident employee's family). Finally, the householder can also be someone without any relatives in the household, and so is not part of any family unit. More details on the family composition of households and the official CPS definitions can be found in the description for FTYPE. 

For the purposes of FAMREL, each subfamily (including the ""primary family only"" subfamily) has a reference person. Thus the ""reference person"" for FAMREL can be in the primary family or any other subfamily unit. (Note that in some CPS documentation the term ""reference person"" refers to the householder only; FAMREL, which is based on the CPS variable PRFAMREL/A-FAMREL, uses the term slightly differently). 

Note that since FAMREL gives the relationship to the subfamily unit, which may not be the entire household, the relationship given by FAMREL is not necessarily the same as the individual's relationship to the householder (RELATE). Thus, for example, a grandchild of the household head could be the reference person of a related subfamily. Additionally, since FAMUNIT is IPUMS-derived and also does not identify related subfamilies, the family identified by FAMUNIT will be different from the subfamily unit that FAMREL refers to. 

Since FAMREL identifies the way in which the individual is related to the subfamily unit, for most years a child (FAMREL=3) can be of any age, and if under 18 can be or have been married. ""Not a family member"" refers to nonfamily householders or individuals unrelated to any subfamily units in the family (secondary individuals).","{0: 'Not a family member', 1: 'Reference person', 2: 'Spouse', 3: 'Child', 4: 'Other relative (primary family only)', 9: 'Missing'}",1

HISPAN,Hispanic origin,discrete,"HISPAN identifies and classifies persons of Hispanic/Spanish/Latino origin.  Origin is ancestry, lineage, heritage, national group, or country of birth.   

Prior to 2003, information was collected by asking, ""What is the origin or descent of each person in this household?"" and asking the respondent to select the appropriate category from a limited number of choices on a flashcard (including ""another group not listed."")   The choices included five to eight choices that would be classified as Hispanic, ""Negro"" and ""Black,"" and a small number of European ancestry groups such as ""German.""  

The primary intention of the question was to identify Hispanic respondents, rather than origin or descent for the general population.  Beginning in 1976, the original CPS data preserved detail for only the Hispanic responses, with all others answers lumped together as ""another group not listed"" (relabeled ""Not Hispanic"" in IPUMS-CPS). 

In 2003 and later years, respondents were asked, ""Are you Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino?"" rather than the broad query about origin or descent.  Detailed information about Hispanic ethnicity was collected only from those who answered ""yes"" to this initial question.","{0: 'Not Hispanic', 100: 'Mexican', 102: 'Mexican American', 103: 'Mexicano/Mexicana', 104: 'Chicano/Chicana', 108: 'Mexican (Mexicano)', 109: 'Mexicano/Chicano', 200: 'Puerto Rican', 300: 'Cuban', 400: 'Dominican', 500: 'Salvadoran', 600: 'Other Hispanic', 610: 'Central/South American', 611: 'Central American, (excluding Salvadoran)', 612: 'South American', 901: 'Do not know', 902: 'N/A (and no response 1985-87)'}",1
EMPSTAT,Employment status,discrete,"EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. The variable also provides information on the activity (e.g., doing housework, attending school,) or status (e.g., retired, unable to work) of persons not in the labor force, as well as limited additional information on those who are in the labor force (e.g. members of the Armed Forces, those with a job, but not at work last week). See LABFORCE for a dichotomous variable identifying whether a person participated in the labor force.

In the CPS, individuals' employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week.  Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as ""at work.""  Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading ""has job, not at work last week.""

Because the CPS is designed to measure unemployment in the civilian population, the original employment status variable in the survey classifies members of the armed forces as NIU (Not in universe).

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force.  Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and either reported looking for work as their major activity during the previous week (for 1962 through 1993) or answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. A separate CPS variable specifying whether an unemployed person had worked before or was looking for a first job was used to distinguish between ""experienced"" and ""inexperienced"" unemployed persons in IPUMS CPS.

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, ""not in labor force.""  Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).","{0: 'NIU', 1: 'Armed Forces', 10: 'At work', 12: 'Has job, not at work last week', 20: 'Unemployed', 21: 'Unemployed, experienced worker', 22: 'Unemployed, new worker', 30: 'Not in labor force', 31: 'NILF, housework', 32: 'NILF, unable to work', 33: 'NILF, school', 34: 'NILF, other', 35: 'NILF, unpaid, lt 15 hours', 36: 'NILF, retired'}",1

OCC,Occupation,contin,"OCC reports the person's primary occupation.  Respondents who held more than one job were to report the job at which they worked the largest number of hours.  For persons who were employed at the time of the survey, OCC relates to the job worked during the preceding week; unemployed persons and those not currently in the labor force were to give their most recent occupation.   The CPS interviewer collected information by asking what kind of work the person was doing, and Census Bureau staff coded the information into the contemporary CPS or census occupational classification.  Researchers who wish to work with a consistent occupational coding scheme for 1968 forward should use the OCC1950 variable.  For general discussion of employment concepts, including the definition of those not in the labor force, see the documentation on EMPSTAT.",{},0
OCC2010,"Occupation, 2010 basis",discrete,"OCC2010 is a harmonized occupation coding scheme based on the Census Bureau's 2010 occupation classification scheme.  Similar variables are offered for the 1950 (OCC1950) and 1990 (OCC1990) classification codes. OCC2010 offers researchers a consistent, long-term classification of occupations.    

The occupational coding scheme in CPS data has changed several times since the 1960s.  The CPS's occupational coding scheme has mirrored that of the Census Bureau, though the CPS has always introduced major coding changes one-to-three years later than the Census Bureau. All original occupational information is stored in the OCC variable.  The meaning of codes in the OCC variable changes with each new coding scheme.  

In the interest of harmonization, however, the scheme has been modified to achieve the most consistent categories across time.  That is, some categories that provide more detail in the 2010 scheme were grouped together because earlier categories are inseparable when more than one occupation is coded together.  For users who wish to further aggregate occupation to broader categories, the 2010 scheme is generally organized by the following groups:

Management in Business, Science, and Arts = 10-430
Business Operations Specialists = 500-730
Financial Specialists = 800-950
Computer and Mathematical = 1000-1240
Architecture and Engineering = 1300-1540
Technicians = 1550-1560
Life, Physical, and Social Science = 1600-1980
Community and Social Services = 2000-2060
Legal = 2100-2150
Education, Training, and Library = 2200-2550
Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media = 2600-2920
Healthcare Practitioners and Technicians = 3000-3540
Healthcare Support = 3600-3650
Protective Service = 3700-3950
Food Preparation and Serving = 4000-4150
Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance = 4200-4250
Personal Care and Service = 4300-4650
Sales and Related = 4700-4965
Office and Administrative Support = 5000-5940
Farming, Fisheries, and Forestry = 6005-6130
Construction = 6200-6765
Extraction = 6800-6940

Production = 7700-8965
Transportation and Material Moving = 9000-9750
Military = 9800-9830
No Occupation = 9920

We followed a process of constructing and testing OCC2010 that is similar to OCC1990's process, which is discussed in more detail in this BLS working paper.  We performed a variety of tests to ensure that the new categories are as robust as possible over the long-term.

IND,Industry,contin,"IND reports the type of industry in which the person performed his or her primary occupation, which is recorded in the variables OCC (Occupation) and, after 1968, OCC1950 (Occupation, 1950 basis).  ""Industry"" refers to the work setting and economic sector, while ""occupation"" relates to the worker's specific technical function.
  
For persons who were employed at the time of the survey, IND relates to the industrial sector in which the respondent worked during the preceding week.  For unemployed persons and those not currently in the labor force, IND characterizes the industrial sector of the respondent's most recent job.   The CPS interviewer collected information by asking what kind of work the person was doing, and Census Bureau staff coded the information into the CPS or census industrial classification.  Researchers who wish to work with a consistent industrial coding scheme for 1968 forward should use the IND1950 variable.

For persons employed at the time of the survey, CLASSWKR relates to the respondent's job during the previous week.

For more detailed discussion, see DURUNEMP, which presents the same information in nonintervalled form.

Beginning in 1988, DURUNEMP also indicates the number of continuous weeks of layoff for workers who were laid off from a job (due, for example, to slow business conditions) but expected to return to the same job.  If a respondent reported being absent from a job during the preceding week due to temporary (under 30 days) or indefinite (30 days or more) layoff, the interviewer asked, ""How many weeks ago were you laid off?""

EDUC,Educational attainment recode,discrete,"EDUC indicates respondents' educational attainment, as measured by the highest year of school or degree completed. Note that completion differs from the highest year of school attendance; for example, respondents who attended 10th grade but did not finish were classified in EDUC as having completed 9th grade. 

EDUC is a combination of two other variables, HIGRADE and EDUC99, which measure educational attainment in different ways.  HIGRADE is available for years prior to 1992 and gives the respondent's highest grade of school or year of college completed.  EDUC99 is available beginning in 1992 and classifies high school graduates according to their highest degree or diploma attained.  

General and detailed codes are not yet available for IPUMS-CPS, but one can construct the general version of EDUC by reading only the first two columns of EDUC.","{0: 'NIU or no schooling', 1: 'NIU or blank', 2: 'None or preschool', 10: 'Grades 1, 2, 3, or 4', 11: 'Grade 1', 12: 'Grade 2', 13: 'Grade 3', 14: 'Grade 4', 20: 'Grades 5 or 6', 21: 'Grade 5', 22: 'Grade 6', 30: 'Grades 7 or 8', 31: 'Grade 7', 32: 'Grade 8', 40: 'Grade 9', 50: 'Grade 10', 60: 'Grade 11', 70: 'Grade 12', 71: '12th grade, no diploma', 72: '12th grade, diploma unclear', 73: 'High school diploma or equivalent', 80: '1 year of college', 81: 'Some college but no degree', 90: '2 years of college', 91: ""Associate's degree, occupational/vocational program"", 92: ""Associate's degree, academic program"", 100: '3 years of college', 110: '4 years of college', 111: ""Bachelor's degree"", 120: '5+ years of college', 121: '5 years of college', 122: '6+ years of college', 123: ""Master's degree"", 124: 'Professional school degree', 125: 'Doctorate degree', 999: 'Missing/Unknown'}",1
EDUC99,"Educational attainment, 1990",discrete,"EDUC99 reports the respondent's highest level of educational attainment.

SCHLCOLL,School or college attendance,discrete,"SCHLCOLL indicates whether respondents age 16 to 24 (or 16 to 54 for ASEC 2013 onward) were enrolled in high school or college during the previous week, and, if so, whether they were enrolled full- or part-time.  College or high school students who were currently on holiday or seasonal vacation were to answer yes, but those not taking classes during summer vacation were to answer no.  Interviewers first asked whether the person was enrolled in school during the previous week, then determined whether the person was attending high school or attending a college or university, and finally asked whether the person was a full-time or part-time student.  In IPUMS-CPS, these responses are combined into the single variable SCHLCOLL.","{0: 'NIU', 1: 'High school full time', 2: 'High school part time', 3: 'College or university full time', 4: 'College or university part time', 5: 'Does not attend school, college or university'}",0

DIFFCARE,Personal care limitation,discrete,"DIFFCARE indicates whether respondents have any physical or mental health condition that makes it difficult for them to take care of their own personal needs, such as bathing, dressing, or getting around inside the home.

DIFFCARE was drawn from the final CPS interview, conducted 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.

DIFFANY,Any difficulty,discrete,"DIFFANY indicates whether the respondent has any physical or cognitive difficulty, as measured by an affirmative response to at least one of the CPS' six physical or cognitive difficulties (DIFFHEAR, DIFFEYE, DIFFREM, DIFFPHYS, DIFFMOB, and DIFFCARE).

These data are collected in MISH 1 and 5 unless the household is new to the CPS. For additional information, see BLS frequently asked questions about disability data.

Researchers using these data should also note that estimates of disability prevalence from CPS are lower than estimates from other large-scale datasets.","{0: 'NIU', 1: 'No difficulty', 2: 'Has difficulty'}",1
EARNWT,Earnings weight,contin,"EARNWT is a person-level weight that should be used in any analysis including one of the following variables: EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, UNION, UHRSWORKORG, WKSWORKORG, ELIGORG, and OTPAY. For any other analysis using ASEC data, researchers should use ASECWT or for analyses of non-ASEC data, WTFINL.

Individuals in the 6 rotation groups that were not asked the ""earner study"" questions (covering EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, UNION, UHRSWORKORG, WKSWORKORG, ELIGORG, and OTPAY) have a value of zero for EARNWT. Even in the 2 rotation groups where ""earner study"" questions were fielded, members of the armed forces have a value of zero for EARNWT.  

According to Technical Paper 66, issued jointly by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals eligible for the earner study are civilians age 15 and older in rotation groups 4 or 8 who are not self-employed. In the data itself, this is true in all samples up to and including those in 1997. From 1998 to 2010, only individuals age 16 and older in rotation groups 4 or 8, and are not self-employed, are in universe for this variable. This universe also applies to basic monthly samples after 2010. In ASEC samples after 2010, the data reflect the published universe.

In any given month, approximately 1/4 of the CPS sample is in the earner study and each household should appear in the earner study exactly twice. Based on documentation from Unicon and  NBER, and after an inspection of the original CPS data, we recommend that users impose the CPS eligibility restrictions in any analyses of earner study variables.",{},0
LINENO,Line number on original form,contin,"LINENO indicates the numbered line on which the CPS interviewer recorded a household member's name, on a form called the ""control card,"" when the interviewer drew up the roster of all household members.  Normally the head of the household was listed on the first line, followed by the spouse, their children, members of subfamilies (in the same order), and unrelated persons.  

LINENO is useful for researchers analyzing the following variables related to health insurance: PRIVWHO1, PRIVWHO2, GRPWHO1, and GRPWHO2.  PRIVWHO1 and PRIVWHO2 indicate the line numbers of the first and second members of the household who were the policyholders for privately-purchased (i.e., not employment-based) insurance covering the respondent during the previous calendar year. GRPWHO1 and GRPWHO2 indicate the line numbers of the first and second members of the household who were the policyholders for employment-based insurance covering the respondent during the previous calendar year.",{},0
